          But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
          pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
          account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
          explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one
          rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,
          but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
          encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there
          anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself,
          because it is pain,
        </p>

          but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain
          can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which
          of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain
          some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man
          who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or
          one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the
          other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who
          are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the
          moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and
          trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who
          fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as
          saying through shrinking from toil and pain.
